MoP
================

This is a growing collection of functions that I have found useful for performing bioinformatics and computational biology related analyses.

Requirements
------------
* python 3
* pandas
* numpy
* pybedtools
* matplotlib
* matplotlib-venn

Installation
------------
The only way to install MoP is by cloning the GitHub repository. Enter the directory
where you would like to download the repository and enter the following commands on
the command line::

    git clone https://github.com/wayneidoyle/pybioutils.git
    cd pybioutils
    python setup.py install

I wrote this code using a conda environment, and I can't guarantee how well setup.py will work. To set-up the same conda environment please folow this `guide <docs/conda_guide.rst>`_.

Tutorials and FAQs

Coming soon!


Acknowledgments
---------------
Many of these functions were inspired by code I found on GitHub or StackOverflow. I have tried to directly acknowledge the people that inspired each function in the corresponding documentation. If I missed you, please let me know and I will update it!
